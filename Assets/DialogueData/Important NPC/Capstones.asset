  - 'Ah yes, I suppose you may not know about them.

    Here. I''ll explain them
    briefly.'
  - Capstones are essentially mystical items which are said to grant the bearer immense
    knowledge when gathered.
  - However, each Capstone was sealed away within Various Dungeons in an attempt
    to safeguard them.
  - It worked initially, but then weird monsters and gates appeared, preventing access
    to them unless a person can surpass their trials.
  - Which in turn, I am led to believe you're someone who wishes to explore them,
    yes?
