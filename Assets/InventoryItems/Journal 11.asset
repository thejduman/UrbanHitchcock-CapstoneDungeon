  information: A user can be authenticated in four different ways. They can be authenticated
    using something they know like a password or PIN. They can use something they
    possess such as an electronic keycard or smart card. This type of authenticator
    is referred to as a token. They can use something they are, which is referred
    to as static biometrics. Examples of static biometrics are recognition by fingerprint,
    retina, and face. Lastly, they can use something they do, which is referred to
    as dynamic biometrics. Some examples of dynamic biometrics are voice pattern,
    handwriting characteristics, and typing rhythm.
