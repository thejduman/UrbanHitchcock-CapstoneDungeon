  information: Symmetric encryption uses only one key (the secret key) to encrypt
    and decrypt messages. The process of symmetric encryption begins with the plaintext,
    which is the message to be encrypted. The plaintext is then processed through
    an encryption algorithm, along with the secret key, to produce the ciphertext.
    The ciphertext is the encrypted message that can only be decrypted with the secret
    key.
