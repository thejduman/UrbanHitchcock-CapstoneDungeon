  information: Symmetric encryption is vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks and brute-force
    attacks. A cryptanalytic attack is where the attacker only has the ciphertext
    and tried to deduce information about the plaintext and the encryption algorithm
    used. A brute-force attack is where the attacker tries every combination of keys
    until the correct key is found.
