  information: Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent sensitive information
    from unauthorized access attempts. It is common for data to be categorized according
    to the amount and type of damage that could be done if it fell into the wrong
    hands. More or less stringent measures can then be implemented according to those
    categories.
